<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

PowerShell has a great templating engine already in [Plaster](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Plaster), but I've found it difficult to work with. Scaffolding with `Invoke-Plaster` is difficult, requiring you to specify the full path to the template you want to use. Authoring templates is complicated with a complex XML manifest file and a template syntax that is while very powerful, also not the friendliest to write. Packaging and sharing templates is an after thought at best. I believe that all of these traits lead to `Plaster` not being used as much as a templating engine should be.

`PShape` is a modern PowerShell templating and scaffolding engine designed to address all of these issues. When scaffolding you use a template's name, rather than having to specify a path. Authoring is greatly simplified with a slim manifest file, authored in JSON, with useful default behavior. The template files are authored using [Moustache](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html) a very simple "logic-less" templating syntax. Packaging templates is as simple as creating a PowerShell module (a PShape template exists for that!) with a `PShapes` directory and sharing is as easy as publishing that module to the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/). My hope is that all of this means there will be plenty of templates contributed by the community, but `PShape` comes with a core set of templates out of the box.

### Built With

The following build tools are used in the creation of `PShape`, but they are all (with the obvious exception of PowerShell Core 7) bootstrapped by the `build.ps1` script.

Note: As a modern PowerShell templating engine there's currently a requirement for PowerShell Core 7. If you need to use `PShape` on an older PowerShell version I'm taking pull requests. :)

* [InvokeBuild](https://github.com/nightroman/Invoke-Build)
* [PSScriptAnalyzer](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer)
* [Pester](https://pester.dev/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

`PShape` is very friendly to use and is distributed as a PowerShell module in the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/).

### Installation

To use `PShape` the first thing you'll need to do is install the module.

```PowerShell
PS> Install-Module PShape -Scope CurrentUser
```

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

If you haven't already done so, you should import the `PShape` module (consider adding this to your profile).

```PowerShell
PS> Import-Module PShape
```

With `PShape` imported you can get a list of the known templates (at this point it's likely only the default templates that come with the `PShape` module).

```PowerShell
PS> Get-PShapeTemplate
```

You can generate files from a template by simply specifying the template name.

```PowerShell
PS> New-PShape -Name script -InputObject @{ name = 'myscript' }
```

You can read a lot more information about using `PShape` by reading `about_PShape`.

```PowerShell
PS> Get-Help about_PShape
```

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [ ] Publish 1.0 package to the PowerShell Gallery

See the [open issues](https://github.com/wekempf/pshape/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

If you have a suggestion that would make this better, please fork the repo and create a pull request. You can also simply open an issue with the tag "enhancement".

Don't forget to give the project a star! Thanks again!

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

Another great way to contribute is to simply create `PShape` templates and publish them to the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/). See `about_PShape` for more information on how this is done.
